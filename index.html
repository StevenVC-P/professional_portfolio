                            <h3>Modern Mornings</h3>
                            <p>This was my first group project, my portion was linking the Gnews Api and then creating the cards and carousel.
                                There were several areas I would want to improve this project, from fixing the postioning of the buttons, and adding addtional criteria
                                to the search function to give the user more power in getting the articles they want.

                            <p>Assignment from the 3rd week of class.  This is a day planner that allows the user to save notes for each section.
                                The purpose of this homework was to show our ability to both use local storage.  Notably the save buttons are for each textarea.
                                What I'm most proud of here is my use of arrays, loops, and if statements, while also keeping the code looking clean.

                            <p>Assignment from the 4th week of class, the goal was to create a page that allows 
                                the user to search for a city then call information from the OpenWeather api.  
                                This project went really well for me, its largest improment would be adding simple checks onto the search input.</p>
